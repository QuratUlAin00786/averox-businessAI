# AVEROX CRM Architecture

## Overview

AVEROX CRM is a comprehensive AI-powered business solution platform designed with a modular, domain-driven architecture. The system provides enterprise management capabilities with intelligent insights, featuring user management, customer relationship management, lead tracking, opportunity pipeline management, product management, proposal generation, invoicing, and AI-powered business analytics.

The application is built with modern web technologies, following a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and shared code.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The application follows a modular, domain-driven design with these key components:

```
/
├── client/                # React frontend application
├── server/                # Express.js backend
├── shared/                # Shared code and models
├── scripts/               # Database and utility scripts
├── docker/                # Docker configuration files
└── migrations/            # Database migration files
```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with Express Session
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe

## Key Components

### Frontend (Client)

The frontend is a React application built with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS. It uses Shadcn UI components for a consistent design system. Key aspects include:

- **Component Structure**: Uses a modern React component architecture with functional components and hooks
- **State Management**: Utilizes React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Implements client-side routing with Wouter
- **Form Handling**: Uses React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
- **UI Components**: Leverages Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling

### Backend (Server)

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, following a modular architecture:

- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints organized by domain
- **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation
- **Data Access Layer**: Database interactions via Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session-based authentication
- **Middleware**: Request processing, error handling, and permission checking

### Database

The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database interactions:

- **Schema Organization**: Domain-specific schema definitions in the shared directory
- **Migrations**: Database migrations managed with Drizzle Kit
- **Entity Relationships**: Comprehensive data model with relations between entities
- **Enums**: Extensive use of PostgreSQL enums for type safety

Key database entities include:
- Users and authentication
- Contacts, accounts, and leads
- Opportunities and sales pipeline
- Tasks and activities
- Proposals and documents
- Invoices and billing
- Products and inventory
- Social media integrations
- Manufacturing and materials management (specialized module)

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication using Passport.js
- **Password Security**: Secure password handling with scrypt hashing and salting
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control system with granular permissions
- **Session Management**: Express session for maintaining user state

### AI Integration

The application integrates with OpenAI's API to provide intelligent insights:

- **Business Insights**: AI-generated analysis of business data
- **Recommendation Engine**: Personalized recommendations for users
- **Content Generation**: AI-assisted content creation for proposals and communications

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request Flow**:
   - Client makes API request to the server
   - Request is processed through Express middleware
   - Authentication and permission checks are applied
   - Controller handles the request and calls appropriate service methods
   - Service interacts with the database through Drizzle ORM
   - Response is formatted and returned to the client

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - React Query manages data fetching, caching, and synchronization
   - Real-time updates are handled through API polling

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User credentials are validated against stored hashed passwords
   - Session is established upon successful authentication
   - Session cookie maintains authentication state across requests
   - Permission checks enforce access control based on user role

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party APIs

- **OpenAI API**: Used for AI-powered insights and recommendations
- **Stripe API**: Integrated for payment processing and subscription management
- **SendGrid**: Email communication service

### External Libraries

- **Frontend**:
  - React and React DOM
  - TanStack React Query
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Radix UI components
  - React Hook Form
  - Zod for validation

- **Backend**:
  - Express.js
  - Passport.js
  - Drizzle ORM
  - OpenAI Node.js SDK
  - Stripe Node.js SDK

## Deployment Strategy

The application supports multiple deployment options:

### Docker-based Deployment

- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container deployment with application and database
- **Dockerfiles**: Separate Dockerfiles for client and server components
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables for configuration

### Self-Hosted Deployment

- Dedicated package.json for self-hosted deployments
- Separate configuration for production environments
- Scripts for database initialization and seeding

### Development Environment

- Supports local development with hot reloading
- Replit compatibility for cloud development
- Development-specific tools and configurations

### Database Setup

- Database migration and initialization scripts
- Support for PostgreSQL in both containerized and external configurations
- Demo data generation for testing and development

## Scaling Considerations

- **Modular Architecture**: Enables independent scaling of components
- **Stateless Backend**: Facilitates horizontal scaling of the server layer
- **Database Performance**: Optimized queries and indexing strategies
- **Caching Strategy**: Client-side caching with React Query

## Future Architectural Considerations

- **Microservices**: Potential decomposition into domain-specific microservices
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Introduction of event bus for inter-service communication
- **GraphQL API**: Consideration for GraphQL to optimize data fetching
- **Serverless Functions**: Potential for serverless deployment of specific functions
